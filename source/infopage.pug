                    As 2016 changes to 2017 we continue to see the usual steady stream of new bingo sites on the Dragonfish network and on the two Cozy networks, plus the occasional
                    Jumpman powered bingo site. Playtech/Virtue Fusion launches on the other hand remain few and far between; although in our opinion the Playtech platform is superior
                    the setup cost is greater for the operator.
